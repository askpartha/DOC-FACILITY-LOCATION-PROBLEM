  abstract = {This paper proposes a new multi objective genetic algorithm (MOGA)
	for solving unequal area facility layout
	
	problems (UA-FLPs). The genetic algorithm suggested is based upon
	the slicing structure where the
	
	relative locations of the facilities on the floor are represented
	by a location matrix encoded in two chromosomes.
	
	A block layout is constructed by partitioning the floor into a set
	of rectangular blocks using
	
	guillotine cuts satisfying the areas requirements of the departments.
	The procedure takes into account
	
	four objective functions (material handling costs, aspect ratio, closeness
	and distance requests) by means
	
	of a Pareto based evolutionary approach. The main advantage of the
	proposed formulation, with respect
	
	to existing referenced approaches (e.g. bay structure), is that the
	search space is considerably wide and
	
	the practicability of the layout designs is preserved, thus improving
	the quality of the solutions obtained.},

	hubs, aiming to minimize the total cost, which is composed of fixed

	The problem is formulated as a maximal covering problem with multiple

	Sensor Network (WSN) designed to monitor a critical facility in a
	hostile region. The sensors are dropped from an aircraft, and they
	must be connected (directly or via hops) to a High Energy Communication
	Node (HECN), which serves as a relay from the ground to a satellite
	or a high-altitude aircraft. The sensors are assumed to have fixed

	movements in and out of the facility, while minimizing both the likelihood
	of sensors being discovered and the number of sensors to be dropped.
	The algorithm is also tested on two other scenarios; in the first
	one the WSN must detect movements in and out of a circular area,
	and in the second one it must cover uniformly a square region. The
	MOGA is shown again to perform well on those scenarios, which shows
	its flexibility and possible application to more complex mission
