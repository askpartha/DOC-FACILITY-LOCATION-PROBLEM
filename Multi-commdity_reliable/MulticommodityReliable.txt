Multi-commodity, single stage, capacitated reliable facility location problem

1. Introduction: Why should one study this problem?
				1. Reliable papers
				2. Multi-commodity
2. Literature:  1. capacitated
				2. multi-commodity
				3. reliable
				4. scatter search
3. Mixed integer programming model: 
				0. Problem type: UFL
				1. Objective (expected, robustness, VaR)
4. Scatter search based solution approach:
size of refset 20-- 10 good quality, 10 diversified 
Population 100

				1. seed solution
				2. diversification generation (Population)
				3. improvement method:
					-feasibility
					-improvement
				4. refset selection: 10 good quality and 10 diversified
				5. subset generation
				- all subsets of size 2
				- subsets of size 3-- add the best solution with each of the pairs generated above
									-- add the most diverified solution with each of the pairs generated above
				6. solution combination: take the union of the facilities in each of the solutions to be combined, then close 
				6.5 Refset update: better quality or more diversified
				7. improvement method: local search-- neighbourhood swap and shift, move to the first better solution 
				8. termination criterion: number of iterations
				9. Refset rebuilding: try with the best solution as seed
5. Computational experiment:
				1.
