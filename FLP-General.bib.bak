  abstract = {In many computer communications network design problems, such as those
	faced by hospitals, universities,
	
	research centers, and water distribution systems, the topology is
	fixed because of geographical and physical
	
	constraints or the existence of an existing system. When the topology
	is known, a reasonable approach to design
	
	is to select components among discrete alternatives for links and
	nodes to maximize reliability subject to cost.
	
	This problem is NP-hard with the added complication of a very computationally
	intensive objective function. This
	
	paper compares the performance of three classic metaheuristic procedures
	for solving large and realistic versions
	
	of the problem: hillclimbing, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms.
	Three alterations that use local search
	
	to seed the search or improve solutions during each iteration are
	also compared. It is shown that employing local
	
	search during evolution of the genetic algorithm, a memetic algorithm,
	yields the best network designs and does
	
	so at a reasonable computational cost. Hillclimbing performs well
	as a quick search for good designs, but cannot
	
	identify the most superior designs even when computational effort
	is equal to the metaheuristics.},

  abstract = {Supply chain disruptions come with catastrophic consequences in spite
	of their low probability of
	
	occurrence. In this paper, we consider a facility location problem
	in the presence of random facility
	
	disruptions where facilities can be protected with additional investments.
	While most existing models
	
	in the literature implicitly assume that the disruption probability

	we investigate the impact of misestimating the disruption probability.
	Using a stylized continuous

	results in greater increase
	
	in the expected total cost than overestimation. In addition, we show
	that, when planned properly,
	
	the cost of mitigating the misestimation risk is not too high. Under
	a more generalized setting
	
	incorporating correlated disruptions and nite capacity, we numerically
	show that underestimation

	increase in the expected total

	design reliable
	
	networks that perform as well as possible under normal conditions,
	while also performing
	
	relatively well when disruptions strike. We present a mixed-integer
	programming model
	
	whose objective is to minimize the nominal cost (the cost when no
	disruptions occur)
	
	while reducing the disruption risk using the p-robustness criterion
	(which bounds the cost
	
	in disruption scenarios). We propose a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm
	that is based on
	
	genetic algorithms, local improvement, and the shortest augmenting
	path method. Numerical
	
	tests show that the heuristic greatly outperforms CPLEX in terms of
	solution speed,
	
	while still delivering excellent solution quality. We demonstrate
	the tradeoff between
	
	the nominal cost and system reliability, showing that substantial
	improvements in reliability
	
	are often possible with minimal increases in cost. We also show that
	our model produces

	robustness
