	erations research.We present the basic mathematical models used in

	¯eld, as well as their properties and relationship with pseudo-Boolean
	
	functions. We also investigate the theory of PLS-complete problems,
	
	average and worst case computational complexity of the local search

	tationally di±cult test instances and promising directions for further

  abstract = {In this paper, we study approximation algorithms for several NP-hard
	facility
	
	location problems. We prove that a simple local search heuristic yields
	polynomialtime
	
	constant-factor approximation bounds for metric versions of the uncapacitated
	
	k-median problem and the uncapacitated facility location problem.
	ŽFor the
	
	k-median problem, our algorithms require a constant-factor blowup
	in the parame-
	
	ter k.. This local search heuristic was first proposed several decades
	ago and has
	
	been shown to exhibit good practical performance in empirical studies.
	We also
	
	extend the above results to obtain constant-factor approximation bounds
	for the
	
	metric versions of capacitated k-median and facility location problems.},

	we originally developed for the p-median problem. We show extensive
	empirical evidence to the effectiveness of our
	
	algorithm in practice. For most benchmarks instances in the literature,
	we obtain solutions that are either optimal
	
	or a fraction of a percentage point away from it. Even for pathological
	instances (created with the sole purpose of being
	
	hard to tackle), our algorithm can get very close to optimality if
	given enough time. It consistently outperforms other
	
	heuristics in the literature.},
