  abstract = {In this paper we introduce the multi-period incremental service facility
	location problem where the goal is to set a number of new
	
	facilities over a finite time horizon so as to cover dynamically the
	demand of a given set of customers.We prove that the coefficient
	
	matrix of the allocation subproblem that results when fixing the set
	of facilities to open is totally unimodular. This allows to solve
	
	efficiently the Lagrangean problem that relaxes constraints requiring
	customers to be assigned to open facilities. We propose a
	
	solution approach that provides both lower and upper bounds by combining
	subgradient optimization to solve a Lagrangean dual
	
	with an ad hoc heuristic that uses information from the Lagrangean
	subproblem to generate feasible solutions. Numerical results
	
	obtained in the computational experiments show that the obtained solutions
	are very good. In general, we get very small percent
	
	gaps between upper and lower bounds with little computation effort.},
