	location problem},
  journal = {Computers \& Operations Research},
  year = {2001},
  volume = {28},
  pages = {411-427},
  abstract = {There are substantial number of exact and heuristic solution methods
	proposed for solving the facilities
	
	location problems. This paper develops an algorithm to solve the capacitated,
	multi-commodity, multiperiod
	
	(dynamic), multi-stage facility location problem. The literature on
	such composite facility location
	
	problem is still sparse. The proposed algorithm consists of two parts:
	in the "rst part branch and bound is
	
	used to generate a list of candidate solutions for each period and
	then dynamic programming is used to "nd
	
	the optimal sequence of con"gurations over the multi-period planning
	horizon. Bounds commonly known in
	
	the location literature as delta and omega are used extensively to
	e!ectively reduce the total number of
	
	transshipment subproblems needed to be solved. The proposed algorithm
	is particularly e!ective when the
	
	facility reopening and closing costs are relatively signi"cant in
	the multi-period problem. An example
	
	problem is included to illustrate the proposed solution procedure.},

  journal = {European Journal of Operational Research},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {165},
  pages = {157-181},
  abstract = {Trade-offs in global manufacturing decisions involve markets, resource
	costs, trade-barriers, currency exchange
	
	rates, joint ventures and investments. We develop a model that optimizes
	plant investment decisions, while ensuring
	
	that the plant investment overhead is optimally absorbed by products
	produced from that plant. The model also,
	
	simultaneously, determines prices by products and countries. The special
	structure of the model is exploited to construct
	
	a fast solution procedure. The model is used to study the implications
	of labor cost, transportation cost, demand, and
	
	import tariff on production quantities, investment, and overhead absorption
	pattern. Implications of changes in other
	
	global parameters such as local-content rule, local taxes, size of
	the market in a country, and long-term exchange rates
	
	are also studied.},

	modeling supply chain networks by
	
	using a pure operations research approach, the resources, data, and

	its use in fast-paced business environments. Hewlett-Packard’s (HP’s)
	strategic planning and modeling (SPaM)
	
	team refined an approach using true optimization coupled with scenario
	analysis, selectively focused on the
	
	most critical parameters of the design equation, and used this approach
	to solve a complex supply chain design
	
	problem for HP’s imaging and printing group. The clear and easily
	demonstrable results helped management to
	
	understand their derivation and act confidently. The combined approach

	capacitated facility location problem with choice of facility type},
  journal = {European Journal of Operational Research},
  year = {1999},
  volume = {115},
  pages = {285-299},
  abstract = {This paper presents exact and heuristic solution procedures for a
	multiproduct capacitated facility location
	
	(MPCFL) problem in which the demand for a number of dierent product
	families must be supplied from a set of
	
	facility sites, and each site oers a choice of facility types exhibiting
	dierent capacities. MPCFL generalizes both the
	
	uncapacitated (or simple) facility location (UFL) problem and the
	pure-integer capacitated facility location problem.
	
	We de®ne a branch-and-bound algorithm for MPCFL that utilizes bounds
	formed by a Lagrangian relaxation of
	
	MPCFL which decomposes the problem into UFL subproblems and easily
	solvable 0-1 knapsack subproblems. The
	
	UFL subproblems are solved by the dual-based procedure of Erlenkotter.
	We also present a subgradient optimization-
	
	Lagrangian relaxation-based heuristic for MPCFL. Computational experience
	with the algorithm and heuristic are
	
	reported. The MPCFL heuristic is seen to be extremely eective, generating
	solutions to the test problems that are on
	
	average within 2% of optimality, and the branch-and-bound algorithm
	is successful in solving all of the test problems to
	
	optimality. Ó 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},
