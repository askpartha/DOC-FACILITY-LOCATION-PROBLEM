  abstract = {In this paper three recurrent neural network algorithms are proposed
	for
	
	the p-median problem according to different techniques. The competitive
	
	recurrent neural network, based on two types of decision variables
	
	(location variables and allocation variables), consists of a single
	layer of
	
	2Np process units (neurons), where N is the number of demand points
	or
	
	customers and p is the number of facilities (medians). The process
	units
	
	form N + p groups, where one neuron per group is active at the same
	
	time and neurons in the same group are updated in parallel. Moreover,
	
	the energy function (objective function) always decreases as the system
	
	evolves according to the dynamical rule proposed. The effectiveness
	and
	
	efficiency of the three algorithms under varying problem sizes are
	analyzed.
	
	The results indicate that the best technique depend on the scale
	
	of the problem and the number of medians.},

  title = {Multifacility Location Problem using Scaled Conjugate Gradient Algorithm
	under Triangular Area Constraints},
  journal = {International Journal of Computer Applications},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {Volume 1 – No. 22},
  pages = {99-103},
  abstract = {The problem of finding the multiple locations for new facilities
	
	with respect to the multiple existing facilities in a given
	
	environment is known as Multifacility Location Problem
	
	(MLP).Every location problem is normally bounded by some sort
	
	of area constraint. But the fact that much of the work carried out
	in
	
	the literature has almost neglected the area constraint which has
	
	motivated us to work on Multifacility Location Problem taking the
	
	area constraint into consideration. The mathematical model of the
	
	multifacility location problem with area constraint has been
	
	developed and the solution has been obtained using Kuhn-Tucker
	
	theory. This mathematical analysis and solution procedure is highly
	
	complex and time consuming. Hence, an attempt has been made to
	
	get the solution of a complex, constrained multifacility location
	
	problem using Scaled Conjugate Gradient Algorithm (SCGA) in
	
	Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). With the help of Numerical
	
	examples, it has been established that the solution obtained through
	
	ANN model compares well within the acceptable limits with those
	
	obtained through analytical method.},
