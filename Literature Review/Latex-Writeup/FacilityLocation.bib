  abstract = {Algorithms to solve Facility Location Problems (FLP) optimally suffer
	from combinatorial explosion and resources
	
	required to solve such problems repeatedly as required in practical
	applications become prohibitive. In these cases heuristic
	
	methods are the only viable alternative. We compare the relative performance
	of Tabu Search (TS), Simulated Annealing
	
	(SA) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) on various types of FLP under time-limited,
	solution-limited, and unrestricted
	
	conditions. The results indicate that TS shows very good performance
	in most cases. The performance of SA and GA are
	
	more partial to problem type and the criterion used. Thus, in general
	we may conclude that TS should be tried first to the
	
	extent that it always yields as good or better results and is easy
	to develop and implement.

	selected facilities.We consider a facility location problem incorporating
	two types of facilities, one that is unreliable and another that
	
	is reliable (which is not subject to disruption, but is more expensive).We
	formulate this as a mixed integer programming model and
	
	develop a Lagrangian Relaxation-based solution algorithm. We derive
	structural properties of the problem and show that for some
	
	values of the disruption probability, the problem reduces to the classical
	uncapacitated fixed charge location problem. In addition, we
	
	show that the proposed solution algorithm is not only capable of solving
	large-scale problems, but is also computationally effective.},

  title = {The Reliable Facility Location Problem: Formulations, Heuristics,
	and Approximation Algorithms},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {We study the reliable facility location problem in which some facilities
	are subject to failure
	
	from time to time. If a facility fails, customers originally assigned
	to it have to be reassigned to
	
	other (operational) facilities. We formulate this problem as a two-stage
	stochastic program and
	
	then a nonlinear integer program. Several heuristics that can produce
	near-optimal solutions are
	
	proposed for this NP-hard problem. For a special case where the probability
	that a facility fails
	
	is a constant (independent of the facility), we provide an approximation
	algorithm with a worst-
	
	case bound of 2.674. The e®ectiveness of our heuristics is tested
	by extensive computational
	
	studies, which also lead to some managerial insights.},

  year = {2010},
  abstract = {Reliable facility location models consider unexpected failures with
	site-dependent probabilities, as well as
	
	possible customer reassignment. This paper proposes a compact mixed
	integer program (MIP) formulation
	
	and a continuum approximation (CA) model to study the reliable uncapacitated

	lem (RUFL) which seeks to minimize initial setup costs and expected
	transportation costs in normal and
	
	failure scenarios.
	
	The MIP determines the optimal facility locations as well as the optimal
	customer assignments, and the
	
	MIP is solved using a custom-designed Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) algorithm.
	The CA model predicts the
	
	total system cost without details about facility locations and customer
	assignments, and it provides a fast
	
	heuristic to ¯nd near-optimum solutions. Our computational results
	show that the LR algorithm is e±cient
	
	for mid-sized RUFL problems and that the CA solutions are close to
	optimal in most of the test instances.
	
	For large-scale problems, the CA method is a good alternative to the

	long running times.},

  abstract = {In this paper we consider a location-optimization problem where the
	classical uncapacitated facility location model is recast in a
	
	stochastic environment with several risk factors that make demand
	at each customer site probabilistic and correlated with demands
	
	at the other customer sites. Our primary contribution is to introduce
	a new solution methodology that adopts the mean–variance
	
	approach, borrowed from the finance literature, to optimize the “Value-at-Risk”
	(VaR) measure in a location problem. Specifically,
	
	the objective of locating the facilities is to maximize the lower
	limit of future earnings based on a stated confidence level. We
	
	derive a nonlinear integer program whose solution gives the optimal
	locations for the p facilities under the new objective. We
	
	design a branch-and-bound algorithm that utilizes a second-order cone
	program (SOCP) solver as a subroutine. We also provide
	
	computational results that show excellent solution times on small
